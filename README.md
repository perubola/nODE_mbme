# nODE_mbme
(Trying) to use neural differential equations to model time series vaginal microbiome data
# Prereqs
Install torchdiffeq from https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq
and torchsde from https://github.com/google-research/torchsde/blob/master/examples/sde_gan.py
# Some comments
Most of the code comes from the examples in the torchsde repo
